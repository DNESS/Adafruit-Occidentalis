  $(basename $0): a simple CLI utility to find a raspberry Pi on the local subnet and do something useful.

  Options:

  -u <user>
      supply a username (default is \`pi\`)

  -p <port>
      supply an ssh port (default is \`22\`)

  -t
     Start an interactive terminal

  -d
     Print useful information and exit

  -c  <cmd list>
     Run some list of commands (place in "")

  -i
     Run the Adafruit Occidentalis bootstrap (default behaviour)

  -s <xxx.xxx.xxx>
  Use a different subnet (assumes netmask 255.255.255.0) . Defaults to the same subnet as this workstation

  -h
    get some simple help (this message)
